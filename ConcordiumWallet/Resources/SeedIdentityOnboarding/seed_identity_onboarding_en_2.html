        All accounts on the Concordium blockchain are tied to an identity. So, you need to verify your identity before you can begin transacting on the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the decentralised nature of the Concordium blockchain, identity verification is done by third parties and not by Concordium.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that Concordium doesn't know your identity. The identity only exists in your wallet and as an encrypted copy with the identity provider.
