    <p>
        All accounts on the Concordium blockchain are tied to an identity. So, you need to verify your identity before
        you can begin transacting on the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the decentralised nature of the Concordium blockchain, identity verification is done by third parties and
        not by Concordium.
