		There are two staking models that a delegator can choose:
        <ul>
            <li>Delegating to a specific pool of your choice</li>
            <li>Passive delegation</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    	A staking pool is managed by an individual validator running a node, so the rewards depend on that validator's performance.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Since passive delegation doesn't go to a specific pool, it mitigates the risk of a single validator performing badly, however, rewards are lower.
