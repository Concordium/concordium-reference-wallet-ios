        A shielded transfer is a transfer from the shielded balance of one account to a shielded balance of another
        account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The amount that is transferred is only visible to the sender and the receiver. The transaction fee is higher
        than a regular transfer and is paid by the sender account.

        You will be able to see a diagram of this on the next slide.
