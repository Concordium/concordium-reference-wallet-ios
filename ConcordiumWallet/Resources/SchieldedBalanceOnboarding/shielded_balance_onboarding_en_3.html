        A shielding transaction is a transfer that moves CCD from your balance to your shielded balance in your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        You decide how much you want to move to the shielded balance. Just make sure the remaining balance is sufficient
        to cover the transaction fees. The amount in this transaction will be visible on the blockchain.
