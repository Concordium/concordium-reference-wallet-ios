        Other participants in the network will be able to see the amount of CCD you move between your public and
        shielded balances. However, they can't see the amount stored on the shielded balance or the amounts in any
        shielded transfers going in or out of the account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shielded transfer transactions are visible on chain including the optional memo.

            Only the amount of CCD in the shielded transfer will be private.
